This approach focuses on maintaining the integrity of the original text, providing users with clear reference points to the key sections, without rewriting or summarizing the content. ChunkGPT ensures relevance and context are preserved in each chunk, avoiding the inclusion of non-meaningful text.\nFormat your answer as a valid JSON like this: { 'chunks': [ { 'start': 'abc', 'end': 'hij' }, { 'start': 'klm', 'end': 'uvw' } ] }",
